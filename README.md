# RDF Viewer

A simple web application for browsing RDF data, built with React, TypeScript, TanStack Query, and rdflib.js.

## Features

- Load RDF data from local files (supports RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples, JSON-LD, N3)
- View a list of named entities in the RDF graph
- Browse entity properties in a table view
- Navigate between entities by clicking on entity references
- Load sample demo data to try out the application

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## How to Use

1. Load an RDF file using the file input at the top of the page, or click "Load Demo Data" to try the application with sample data.
2. Browse the list of entities on the left panel.
3. Click on an entity to view its properties in the right panel.
4. If a property value is a reference to another entity (shown as a clickable link), you can click on it to navigate to that entity.
